# Universal Redux/React-Router/React boilerplate #

## Full ES7 transpiling on client and server ##

### Heroku ready ###

Spinning this up because I'm likely to reuse this in the future. Hope you enjoy it.

Getting started:

  Dev buid:
    * `npm install` / `yarn`
    * `npm run dev` / `yarn run dev`

  Prod buid:
    * `npm run build` / `yarn run build`
    * `npm start` / `yarn run start`


Things to note:

  * Server webpack build will throw errors. It's only a side effect of webpack's Node bugginess. You can fully ignore these errors.
